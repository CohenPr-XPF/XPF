# Lenition
### Spirantization
* X -> [β,ð,ɣ] / {V,tap,trill}__V when X = b,̪d,ɡ

### Voicing
* /h/ -> voiced / X__X when X=i,u,e,o,a
* X -> voiced / __Voiced C for segments X = ̥s, s
* /̥ss, s/ -> voiced / __X (no other voiced Cs occur here) for segments X = m, ̪n, l

### Deletion
* /b,̪d,g,ɾ/ -> 0 / X__X in colloguial relaxed speech for when X = i,u,e,o,a
* /h/ -> 0 / when preceded in a word by aspirated X, or when followed by another /h/

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the patterning and formal description of edge-geminate segments in Chuvash, a Turkic language spoken in the former Chuvash ASSR some 500 miles East of Moscow. I will try to draw together data that shows length alternations, stress, the selection of certain morpheme alternants, and word structure. The analysis is done in the framework of tiered phonology. In order to set the stage for the Chuvash data, I first survey the segmental inventory of Chuvash and then look at the way geminates are represented in current autosegmental work.},

# Background

**Language Family**: Creole / French based

* Speakers of Haitian Creole reside in a multitude of places, including, but not limited to, Haiti, Canada, the United States, France, the Dominican Republic, Cuba, and the Bahamas.

# Phonology

## Consonants

* /ɥ/ is a widely debated phoneme in Haitian Creole, as it only appears in succession with /i/ and can appear in free variation with /w/ [@Kraemer2016, p. 67; @Pindziak2012, pp. 3-4]. I have chosen to treat it as a variant of /w/ and not include it in the phoneme inventory.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'asis'}

library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)


consonants <- read.table(textConnection('
"Manner of Articulation"   Labial     Alveolar   Postalveolar   Palatal   Velar      Glottal
Stops                      "p  b"     "t  d"         ""           ""      "k  ɡ"       ""
Fricatives                 "f  v"     "s  z"       "ʃ  ʒ"         ""       "ɣ"         "h"  
Nasals                       "m"        "n"          ""           ""       "ŋ"         ""
Approximants                 "w"        "l"          ""           "j"      ""          ""
'), TRUE)

kable(consonants, col.names = c("Manner of Articulation", "Labial", "Alveolar", "Postalveolar", "Palatal", "Velar", "Glottal"), align = 'c') %>%
  kable_styling("bordered") %>%
  add_header_above(c("", "Place of Articulation" = 6)) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE) %>%
  footnote(general = "Note: For phonemes that share a cell, those on the left are voiceless and those on the right are voiced.", general_title = "")
```

## Vowels

* Haitian Creole makes a distinction between oral and nasal vowels. Nasal vowels are orthographically represented with a following ⟨n⟩ [@faraclas2010orthography, p. 97].
    - Where a nasal vowel is followed by /n/, it is represented orthographically by two ⟨n⟩s (e.g. ⟨ann⟩ = /ãn/).
* The grave accent (\`) on vowels is used to indicate non-nasality of vowels when followed by ⟨n⟩ [@faraclas2010orthography, p. 101].
    - E.g. ⟨àn⟩ = /an/
* /an/, /en/, /on/, and /un/ also appear as vowel-consonant sequences when followed by a vowel.


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'asis'}

vowels <- read.table(textConnection('
         Front      Central       Back
High      "i"         ""         "u  ũ"
High-Mid  "e"         ""         "o  õ"
Low-Mid  "ɛ  ɛ̃"        ""          "ɔ"
Low       ""        "a  ã"         ""
'), TRUE)

kable(vowels, align = 'c') %>%
  kable_styling("bordered") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE)
```  

# Alphabet

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'asis'}

alphabet <- read.table(textConnection('

"a"           "/a/"

# Lenition Rules

* /ʒ/ becomes /j/ word-finally [@Gurevich2004, p. 112].

# Misc. Rules

* /j/ deletes word-finally following /i/ [@Gurevich2004, p. 112].

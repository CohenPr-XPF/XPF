# Background

Sinhala exhibits diglossia, where the written form contrasts greatly with the spoken form of Sinhala. Written Sinhala is reserved for formal communication, and does not use Sinhala slang or taboo terms. Although spoken Sinhala has various dialects, I've chosen to base my phonology off of formal speech. 

**Language family**: Indo-European, Indo-Aryan, Sinhalese-Maldivian

# Phonology
## Consonants

- Consonant letters have an inherent /a/ following it. For example, the letter representing /k/ would be pronounced [ka].
- Consonant length is contrastive, and long consonants are generally represented in the orthography as the same letter twice.
- Consonant length is important in consonant clusters. In initial position, both consonants are short. In medial position, the first consonant is generally long.
- There are also special "clusters," which are the four prenasalized consonants. The first consonant (a nasal), is very short, and the second consonant is a stop. These "clusters" are thought of each as a single phoneme. However, there are also clusters with a normal nasal and stop that are just regular clusters, not prenasalized stops. These four prenasalized consonants are [???g],[?????],[???d??],[???b].
- [f] is borrowed from English

## Vowels
- Word-initially, vowels appear as their own letters in the orthography. 
- Otherwise, the vowels appear as diacritics on the consonant that's part of the same syllable. 
- Sources say there are seven vowel phonemes: i, e, ae, ??, u, o, a.
- However, [??] and [a] are in complementary distribution, and their realization depends on the phonological environment, which leads me to believe that they are allophones. The underlying form is /a/. 
- Vowel length is a contrastive feature, so there are also long versions of the previous six vowels.
- Sources conflict on what and how many dipthongs there are, but I will say there are two dipthongs, ai and au (which are represented in the orthography). These do not have a length feature.

### Vowel Clusters
- Disanayaka's "The Structure of Spoken Sinhala" suggests that vowel clusters may occur in Sinhala, yet later references don't always agree with this. I interviewed a consultant (born and raised in Colombo, Sinhala) who speaks and reads Standard Sinhala, and the only vowel clusters she spoke was [a i] and [a u] (which is consistent with the orthography). The other vowel clusters suggested by the book usually have a [j] or labiodental approximant in between them, which are pronounced very quickly in normal speech.

## Alphabet
- Syllabic alphabet.
- Horizontal, left to right. 
- There is no uppercase / lowercase.

## Lenition Rules
"Weakened articulation of intervocalic single consonants is very common and is applicable to (a) all stops except retroflex (b) nasals and (c) the semi-vowel /w/."

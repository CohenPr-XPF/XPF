# Background

**Language Family:** Dravidian / Southern / Tamil-Kannada / Tamil-Kodagu / Tamil-Malayalam / Tamil

* Tamil is a language primarily spoken in the Indian state Tamil Nadu, as well in the countries Sri Lanka, Malayasia, and Singapore. Tamil exhibits diglossia, wherein the written variety of the language is formal or literal, and the spoken variety of the language (which is more colloquial) is used in most other contexts. We used Standard Spoken Tamil for this project [@Keane2004, p. 111].

# Phonology

## Consonants

* Unlike other related languages, Tamil doesn't have voiced obstruents or aspirated consonants [@Keane2004, pp. 111-112].
* Like other Dravidian languages, Tamil has multiple rhotic sounds and makes use of the retroflex place of articulation (ibid.).
* All consonants carry an inherent /a/ following the consonant [@Shulman2016, p. 22].
* /dʒ/, /h/, /ʂ/, /ʃ/, /s/, /f/, and /z/ appear in Sanskirt loanwords, and their corresponding graphemes come from the Grantha writing system [@Keane2004, p. 112]. In terms of standard Tamil, @Keane2004 explains them to be rather marginal, so they won't be accounted for.

# Lenition Rules

* Voiceless obstruents become voiced following nasals [@Keane2004, p. 112].
    - Geminate voiceless obstruents remain voiceless.
* Intervocalically [@Schiffman1999, p. 10]:
    - /t̪/ fricates
    - /tʃ/ reduces to /s/
    - /p/ becomes voiced and may spirantize or become a glide
    - /ʈ/ becomes voiced
    - /t/ becomes a flap
    - /k/ debuccalizes to /h/
* Following a nasal, the above stops and affricates become voiced (ibid.).
* Occasionally, /ʋ/ and /k/ delete intervocalically (ibid.).

# Misc. Rules

* All consonants except ⟨ர⟩ and ⟨ழ⟩ can geminate. Although ⟨ர⟩ is underlying the same phoneme as ⟨ற⟩, ⟨ற⟩ is said to be able to undergo gemination [@Schiffman1999, pp. 11-12].

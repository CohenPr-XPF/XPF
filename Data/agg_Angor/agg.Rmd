# Background

**Language Family**: Trans-New Guinea / Senagi

* Angor is spoken in 11 villages within the Sandaun province located in Northern Papua New Guinea.

# Phonology

## Consonants

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'asis'}

library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)


consonants <- read.table(textConnection('
"Manner of Articulation"   Labial     Alveolar    Palatal     Velar   
Stops                    "p  b  ᵐb"  "t  d  ⁿd"     ""      "k  ɡ  ᵑɡ"
Fricatives                  "ɸ"          "s"        ""         "x"
Nasals                      "m"          "n"        ""         "ŋ"
Flaps                       ""           "ɾ"        ""         ""
Approximants                "w"          ""         "j"        ""
'), TRUE)

kable(consonants, col.names = c("Manner of Articulation", "Labial", "Alveolar", "Palatal", "Velar"), align = 'c') %>%
  kable_styling("bordered") %>%
  add_header_above(c("", "Place of Articulation" = 4)) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE) %>%
  footnote(general = "Note: The cells that contain three phonemes are ordered voiceless, voiced, pre-nasalized.", general_title = "")
```

## Vowels

* Vowel harmony is present in Angor [@litteral_features_2008, p. 25].
* Given that the diphthongs can also be realized as vowel sequences [@litteral_angor_1997, p. 4], they won't be represented in the transcription.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'asis'}

vowels <- read.table(textConnection('
         Front      Central       Back
High      "i"         "ɨ"          "u"
Mid       "e"         "ə"          "o"
Low        ""         "a"          ""
'), TRUE)

kable(vowels, align = 'c') %>%
  kable_styling("bordered") %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE)


diphthongs <- read.table(textConnection('
Diphthongs
"/ai/, /au/, /oe/, /oa/, /ou/, /ui/"
'), TRUE)

kable(diphthongs, align = 'c') %>%
  kable_styling("bordered")
```

# Alphabet

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'asis'}

alphabet <- read.table(textConnection('

# Syllable Structure

* Syllables in Angor include the following structures [@litteral_angor_1997, p. 4]:
    - V  
    - VV  
    - VC  
    - CV  
    - CVV  
    - CVC

# Lenition Rules

* /ɸ/ and /x/ can be voiced word-medially [@litteral_angor_1997, p. 4].
* Unstressed word-final vowels are often deleted following either voiceless stops, nasals (including pre-nasals), or /x/ (ibid.).

# Misc. Rules

* /ɾ/ may be realized as retroflex following /a/ [@litteral_angor_1997, p. 4].

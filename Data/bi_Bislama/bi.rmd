## Consonants

```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
library(knitr)
labial <- c("p","b","m","","v","f","","","w")
alveolar <- c("t","d","n","tʃ","","s","ɾ","l","")
palatal <- c("","","","","","","","","j")
velar <- c("k","g","ŋ","","","","","","")
glottal <- c("","","","","","h","","","")

consonants <- data.frame(labial, alveolar, palatal, velar, glottal)
rownames(consonants) <- c("voiceless stops","voiced stops","nasals","voiced fricatives","voiceless fricatives","rhotic","lateral","glides")
kable(consonants)
```
Not all speakers make a contrast between voiced and voiceless stops. Not all speakers make a contrast between /v/ and /f/. [@crowley2004]

## Vowels

{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
library(knitr)
front <- c("i","e","a")
back <- c("u","o","")

vowels <- data.frame(front, back)
rownames(vowels) <- c("close", "close-mid", "open")

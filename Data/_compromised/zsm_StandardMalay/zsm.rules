# Individual
sub,c,tʃ,4,,,
sub,g,ɡ,4,,,
sub,j,dʒ,4,,,
sub,x,k s,4,,
sub,y,j,4,,,
sub,({passthrough}),\1,1,,,
# Digraphs
sub,n,ŋ,5,,g,
sub,n,ɲ,5,,y,
sub,{n-follower},,5,n,,"clean-up",
# Semivowels - <u> and <i> represent /u/ and /i/ when preceded by vowels
sub,i,j,3,{vowels},,
sub,u,w,3,{vowels},,
# Older Conventions
sub,c,tʃ,6,,h{C},"<ch> represents /tʃ/ if followed by a consonant - /CCC/ is not allowed per the syllabic structure, so e.g. <chk> would represent /tʃ k/ rather than /tʃ h k/",
sub,d,d,6,,h{C},
sub,t,s,6,,h{C},
sub,h,,6,{old-digraph},{C},"clean-up",
sub,c,tʃ,6,^,h,"accounts for seemingly /CC/ structures word-initially, which aren't supported by the language",
sub,d,d,6,^,h,
sub,t,s,6,^,h,
sub,h,,6,^{old-digraph},,"clean-up",
sub,c,tʃ,6,,h$,"accounts for seemingly /CC/ structures word-finally, which aren't supported by the language",
sub,d,d,6,,h$,
sub,t,s,6,,h$,
sub,h,,6,{old-digraph},$,"clean-up",
# Misc. Rules
sub,{punct},,2,,,"hyphens represent morpheme boundaries and apostrophes represent phonetic glottal stops",
# Accounting for Loanwords (certain digraphs represent loanword phonemes, that would otherwise be transcribed incorrectly - can only account for those which precede consonants, occur word-initially, and occur word-finally, which may not be exhaustive)

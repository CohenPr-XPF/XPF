# Forms of <i>
# For the phonemes /i/ and /ɨ/, one orthography uses <i> and <ı> respectively, while the other uses <î> and <i>.
# Because the pronunciation of <i> differs by orthography, I currently only support the i/ı orthography.
# To support the other orthography, uncomment lines 36-37, and comment out lines 34-35.

# Misc. Rules
# Because /k/ and /c/ have non-overlapping distribution, it seems likely that they are not contrastive.
# For this reason, the standard ruleset does not factor in /k/-fronting.
# But if you wish to include /k/-fronting, uncomment the following three lines:
# ipasub,k ({frontvowel}),c \1,3,,,"k-fronting (start)"
# ipasub,({frontvowel}) k ({consonant}),\1 c \2,2,,,
# ipasub,({frontvowel}) k$,\1 c,2,,,"k-fronting (end)"
sub,({passthrough}),\1,0.1,,,

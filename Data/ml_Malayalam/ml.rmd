**Language family**: Dravidian, Southern, Tamil-Kannada, Tamil-Kodagu, Tamil-Malayalam, Malayalam

# Phonology
## Consonants
```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
library(knitr)
bilabial <- c("p pʰ", "b bʱ", "m", 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
labiodental <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, "ʋ", 9)
dental <- c("t̪ t̪ʰ", "d̪ d̪ʱ", "n̪", 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
alveolar <- c(1, 2, "n", "r̥ r", "ɾ","s ʃ", "tʃ tʃʰ", 8, "l̥ l")
retroflex <- c("ʈ ʈʰ","ɖ ɖʱ", "ɳ", 4, 5, "ʂ", 7, "ɻ", "ɭ")
palatal <- c(1, "ɟ ɟʱ", "ɲ", 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
velar <- c("k kʰ","g gʱ","ŋ", 4, 5, 6, 7, "j", 9)
glottal <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, "h", 7, 8, 9)
consonants <- data.frame(bilabial, labiodental, dental, alveolar, retroflex, palatal, velar, glottal)
row.names(consonants) <- c("Voiceless plosive", "Voiced plosive", "Nasal", "Trill", "Tap or Flap", "Fricative", "Affricate", "Approximant", "Lateral approximant")
kable(consonants, caption = "Note: Two sounds may appear in the same cell if they have the same place and manner. Diacritics will distinguish them.")
```

Plosives have a four-way contrast (voiceless unaspirated, voiceless aspirated, voiced unaspirated, voiced aspirated) [@TEMU].

Consonant length is contrastive [@Jiang2010].

## Vowels

Vowel length is contrastive. The Malalayam vowels include i, e, a, o, u, and their long counterparts. There are diphthongs /ai/ and /au/, which do not have a length contrast [@Mohanan1986].

## Alphabet
- Horizontal, left to right. 
- There is no uppercase / lowercase.
- A consonant letter carries an inherent /a/ or schwa after it, unless a diacritic changes that vowel.
- Sometimes letters will combine with other letters or diacritics to form a single shape, but they are usually written separately.
